      <description>Participated to NHK Student Robot Contest (NHK学生ロボコン) from U-Tokyo team, RoboTech.
I was mostly resposible for mechanical design and entire team manegement. Not only I design the robot, but also I estabilish RoboTech fund to support my team from financial aspect.</description>

      <description>I created flute playing robot when I was an highschool student.
The project including mechanical design, circuit board design, and software design were done all by myself.
It was good memory of me to visited Akihabara(秋葉原) so often to buy some electric parts.</description>

      <description>Learning of Tool Force Adjustment Skills by a Life-sized Humanoid using Deep Reinforcement Learning and Active Teaching Request  Abstract— The purpose of this study is to make life-sized humanoid robots acquire tool manipulation skills that require complicated force adjustment. The difficulty in acquisition of tool manipulation skills comes from the hardship in physical modeling. Recent research has revealed that deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a model-free approach, performs superior in such tasks.</description>
